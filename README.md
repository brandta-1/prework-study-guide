# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

As a bootcamp student, I built this project to initiate my career as a professional developer. This project provides a basic overview of an external CSS file and a javascript file interacting with an HTML file. I learned elementary ways these files can interact, as well as the basics of js functions.
